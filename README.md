# AP Cybersecurity — Work Log

**Period F · 2026–27 · Mr. DeVaughn-Brown · Room U 108**

This repository is your log for the year, and — if you do it properly — it is
also the only study guide you will need in May.

Three reasons it exists.

1. **You are building your own revision document, four lines at a time.** Every
   class you write down the day's one idea in your own words, the terms that
   released, and anything that did not land. In December you run one command and
   five months of that becomes a single document. Nobody can hand you a better
   study guide than the one made out of your own confusion.
2. **I can see where you are.** If you are stuck, I would rather find out on a
   Tuesday than on a unit test.
3. **You are keeping an audit log.** In Unit 4 and Unit 5 I am going to hand you
   somebody else's log and ask you to reconstruct what happened from it. By then
   you will have spent five months writing one. You will read those files very
   differently than someone who has not.


**The exit ticket is not in here.** That stays on an index card, written in
class, handed to me at the door. Nothing about the end of the period changes.

## Setup

You accepted this assignment through Classroom 50 and it made you a repository.
Clone it in our `version_control` directory:

```
mkdir ~/version_control
cd ~/version_control
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ap-cybersecurity-fall-2026-student-log-<your-username>
```

> **Everything for this class lives in `~/version_control`.** Not Downloads, not
> Desktop, not Documents, and never iCloud Drive or Google Drive. Cloud sync and
> git fight each other, and git loses in ways that are genuinely painful to
> undo. One folder, every repo, no sync — then you always know where your work
> is.

If any step below fails, **stop and ask** — do not paste an error into a chatbot
and run whatever it tells you. That habit is how people destroy repositories,
and separately, it is the exact habit this course spends a year arguing against.

> **Already did this for another of my classes?** Steps 1 through 4 are global
> git settings — they are set once per computer, not once per class. Skip to
> step 5.

### 1. Tell git who you are

```
git config --global user.name "Your Real Name"
git config --global user.email "you@sierracanyon.org"
```

Use your real name. Every commit you make this year is signed with it. That is
the point of it.

### 2. Your editor

We set up VS Code on the first day. Tell git to use it:

```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

The `--wait` matters. Without it, git opens the file and immediately carries on
as if you had already saved, so your commit message comes out empty. With it,
git waits for you to close the tab.

If `code` is "command not found," open VS Code, press `Cmd+Shift+P`, type *Shell
Command: Install 'code' command in PATH*, and hit enter. Then quit your terminal
and reopen it — a terminal only learns about new commands when it starts.

### 3. The terminal setup

```
cd git_files
cp git-commit-template.txt ~/.git-commit-template.txt
git config --global commit.template ~/.git-commit-template.txt
cp git-prompt.sh ~/git-prompt.sh
cp git-completion.bash ~/git-completion.bash
cp bash_profile_course ~/.bash_profile
cd ..
```

Quit your terminal completely and reopen it. Your prompt should now be in color
and should show which branch you are on. **That branch name in your prompt is
not decoration** — it is the thing that stops you committing to the wrong place.

### 4. Two settings that prevent specific miseries

```
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global diff.colorMoved zebra
```

Neither of these is cosmetic. Here is what each one is actually stopping.

**`pull.rebase true` — stops your history filling with noise.** When you `git
pull` and the branch has moved on without you, git's default is to invent a new
commit whose only job is to glue the two lines of history together. It says
nothing; you did not write it; and after a few weeks your log is half real work
and half *"Merge branch 'main' of github.com:…"*. With `pull.rebase true`, git
instead lifts your commits off, brings the other work down, and sets your
commits back on top — one straight line, every commit one you actually made.
This matters here more than in most places, because in Unit 5 you will be handed
a log and asked to reconstruct what happened from it. A history you can read is
the entire skill.

**`diff.colorMoved zebra` — stops a moved paragraph looking like a rewrite.** By
default `git diff` has exactly two colours: red for gone, green for new. Cut ten
lines from one part of your log and paste them further down and the diff shows
ten red and ten green — identical to having deleted ten lines and written ten
different ones. `zebra` gives moved lines their own colours, so *moved* and
*rewritten* stop looking the same. You want that the first time you reorganise
an entry and cannot tell what you actually changed.

### 5. Run the entry script

```
bash scripts/start-entry.sh
```

`bash <script>` hands the file to bash and asks it to run the lines inside. That
is why you do not have to make anything executable, and it is the same command
every time.

A file should appear in `logs/` named for today's date, with a timestamp header,
and it should open in your editor. If that happened, setup is done.

---

## Branches: one per unit

**You never work on `main`.** You work on a branch, and you get a new one for
each unit.

Your branch names are your GitHub username plus the unit:

```
jd12-setup      jd12-unit1      jd12-unit2      jd12-unit3 ...
```

My GitHub username is `jd12`, so those are mine. Yours use your username.

Start a branch like this:

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b jd12-unit1
git push -u origin jd12-unit1
```

**Hyphens, not slashes.** `jd12-unit1`, never `jd12/unit1`. Git cannot hold a
branch called `jd12` and a branch called `jd12/unit1` at the same time, and the
error it gives you when you try is not one you want to meet on a Tuesday.

### The schedule

| Branch | Opens | Merges at | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-setup` | Wed 9/2 | end of the first week | **Fri 9/4** |
| `-unit1` | Tue 9/8 | Unit 1 test | **Wed 9/23** |
| `-unit2` | after the U1 test | Unit 2 test | **Mon 11/2** |
| `-unit3` | after the U2 test | Unit 3 test | **Tue 1/12** |
| `-unit4` | after the U3 test | Unit 4 test | **Thu 2/11** |
| `-unit5` | after the U4 test | Unit 5 test | **Thu 3/18** |

## What goes in the log

### File naming

One file per day, in `logs/`, named for the date:

```
logs/2026-09-14.log.md
```

That format sorts correctly when you run `ls`, which is the whole reason for it.
One file holds every entry you write that day.

### The class entry — after every class

Four lines. **The format matters, because a script reads it later.**

```markdown
## M14 — Governance: Who Says So

**Today's one idea:** A policy says what must happen, a standard says exactly
how, and a guideline is only a suggestion. Mixing them up is how a place ends up
with a rule nobody can actually follow.

**Terms released:** Policy · Standard · Procedure · Guideline · Baseline

**Shaky:** still cannot reliably tell a standard from a baseline

**Did:** Sorted 12 documents into the four buckets. Got 9, argued the AUP one,
wrong.
```

Two rules worth taking seriously:

- **"In your own words" is the whole exercise.** If you copy the sentence off
  the board you have written nothing, because in March you will read it back and
  it will mean exactly as much as it did when it was on the board. If you
  *cannot* put it in your own words — that is not a failure. That is the thing
  that goes on the Shaky line.
- **Leave the `Shaky:` line in even when it is empty.** It is what the study
  guide script looks for, and an empty one is a real answer.

**I read the Shaky lines.** I am telling you that in September so it is never a
surprise. I read them to find out what to teach again, not to judge you for what
you did not get — and the tool only works if you are honest in it.

### Sign-on / sign-off — when you work outside class

What you set out to do, then what you actually did and one honest word about
anything you didn't. "No time" is a complete answer. "Got stuck on question 3"
is a better one, because I can act on it.

### Formatting

1. Markdown. Keep this open in a tab for the first two weeks:
   [markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
   You need about six things off it — headings, bold, italic, lists, code,
   links.
2. Entries run oldest-to-newest down the file, in the order they happened.
3. Every entry starts with a timestamp header. The script writes it for you.
4. **Wrap lines at 80 columns.** The Rewrap extension for VS Code does it with
   one keystroke. This is not fussiness — it is so that `git diff` shows me the
   sentence you changed instead of the whole paragraph, which matters in Unit 5
   when you learn what a diff is actually for.

---

## The AI line

Every sign-off entry ends with one line:

```
**AI use:** none.
```

or

```
**AI use:** asked Claude what a subnet mask does; wrote the answer myself.
```

That is the whole policy. **You are not in trouble for using it** — the log is
graded on whether you did it, not how good it is, so there is nothing here to
gain by cheating. You are in trouble for not saying so.

Two reasons this line exists. The narrow one is that I need to know whether the
confusion in your log is yours, because that is the only thing I can teach to.
The broad one is that disclosure is the actual professional norm in this field —
you will spend Unit 1 on responsible disclosure and Unit 5 on incident
reporting, and both come down to the same idea: **the person who tells you what
happened is not the problem.**

---

## Committing, and the pull request

Commit every time you write an entry:

```
git add logs/2026-09-14.log.md
git commit
git push
```

`git commit` with no `-m` opens the template. Keep the top line under 50
characters and write it as a command: *Add class entry for M14*, not *added
class entry*.

**Push the same day you write.** A week of entries pushed the night before a
unit test tells me exactly what it looks like — and unlike an index card, the
timestamps are not something either of us gets to argue about.

### The pull request

A pull request is you saying *this branch is finished, please look at it before
it becomes part of the main record.* That is all it is. It is not a test and it
is not a submission button — it is a request for a reading.

**Open it at the start of the unit**, right after you make the branch, even
though it is empty. Fill in the description as you go. That way I can watch the
work arrive instead of meeting all of it at once on test day.

**Merge it at the unit test**, after I have reviewed it. Then make the next
branch and open the next PR.

### What my review looks like

A comment on your PR with a score out of 12, one thing that worked, and one
question. **The question is the part that matters.** You do not have to answer
it in writing — but you should be able to answer it out loud if I ask you in
class, and sometimes I will.

---

## The payoff: `study-guide.sh`

This is why the four-line format is worth the discipline.

```
bash scripts/study-guide.sh              everything you have written
bash scripts/study-guide.sh 2026-10      just October
bash scripts/study-guide.sh --shaky      only the things you flagged
```

It writes `study-guide.md` at the top of the repository. That file is
git-ignored, so rebuilding it never clutters your commits — run it as often as
you like.

**Use `--shaky` two days before every test.** It gives you a list, in your own
words, of exactly the things you did not understand at the moment you did not
understand them. Anything still on that list is your study plan. Anything you
can now explain out loud, delete from the log — deleting it is the point, and
git remembers it was there.

Before the December midterm and again before the AP exam on **5 May**, run it
with no arguments and read the whole thing. It takes about fifteen minutes and
it is the single highest-value hour of revision available to you, because it is
made entirely of your own thinking rather than somebody else's summary.

---

## Grading

The log is part of **Practice**, which is 5% of your grade and is scored on
**completion only — never on quality.** An entry exists or it does not.

- A class entry for **every meeting**, committed before the next one.
- A sign-on/sign-off pair for **any work you do outside class**. Anki counts.
- **Your three late passes apply here**, same as everywhere else.
- Miss more than **six** class entries in a semester and it stops being free —
  come see me before that happens, not after.

Nothing in here is scored on how smart it sounds. I am not grading the writing.
I am reading it.

## Fixing things

**I committed to `main`.** Nothing is lost.

```
git branch jd12-unit1          # if the branch doesn't exist yet
git checkout jd12-unit1
git merge main
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
git checkout jd12-unit1
```

**My push was rejected.** Somebody — probably you, on another machine — pushed
first. `git pull`, then push again.

**I have a merge conflict.** Stop. Screenshot it and post it to Piazza.
Conflicts are completely routine and completely confusing the first time, and
you will learn more from three minutes with me than an hour of guessing.

**GitHub is asking for a password and rejecting mine.** GitHub does not accept
account passwords for git any more. You need a personal access token — see the
setup card, or ask.

---

## Getting help

Ask me, or post to **Piazza** — that is our class board, and it is the right
place for anything that is not urgent. Include the **exact** command you ran and
the **exact** error, as text, not as a description. "It didn't work" cannot be
helped; a screenshot can.

Answering somebody else's question on Piazza is worth as much as asking a good
one. It is also the single best predictor I know of who ends up understanding
this material.
